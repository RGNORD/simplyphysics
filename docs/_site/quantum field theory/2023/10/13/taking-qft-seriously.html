    <p>If you’re even remotely interested in the philosophy of physics, you’ve
surely heard of quantum mechanics. Hell, nowadays quantum mechanics is
even in your washing machine – who among us would use non-quantum
soap?<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> No doubt you’ve heard all sorts of wonderful things about
quantum particles instantly knowing what happens to their entangled
partner, or being in two places at once, and so on.</p>

<p>Most of the things philosophers have talked about are essentially
features of non-relativistic quantum mechanics; that is, the quantum
mechanics of particles moving fairly slowly compared to the speed of
light. Low-energy stuff. That’s understandable for two reasons. Firstly,
most of the philosophically interesting features of quantum mechanics
are already present in the non-relativistic version (and don’t by any
means disappear in the relativistic version), so there’s plenty to
discuss. Second, a lot of stuff in the real world is mostly dependent on
these low-energy phenomena, such as the properties of materials,
semiconductors and so on.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are legitimate reasons to (philosophically, morally,
aesthetically, drunkenly) care about relativistic quantum mechanics –
quantum field theory (QFT). Plenty of ordinary phenomena are <em>not</em>
low-energy. For example, the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering,
which is a relativistic phenomenon. So you need QFT – and it turns out
that QFT not only inherits the normal quantum problems but adds new ones
on top. This is an introduction to those issues.</p>

<p>I’ve written this article centering around two philosophers of QFT,
Doreen Fraser and David Wallace. They take opposing viewpoints on
important issues in the philosophy of QFT. I’ll admit my bias upfront –
I think Wallace is right, Fraser wrong. I’ll try to give it a fair shake
anyway, and regardless, this text is mostly intended as an introduction
to the issues, not the particular argument.</p>

<h1 id="basic-argument">Basic Argument</h1>

<p>I will start by outlining the arguments in the papers in very general
terms, skipping over details and technicalities. This has the advantage
of immediately naming a host of important issues in QFT, which I’ll then
deal with in turn in later sections.</p>

<p>Quantum field theory is more of a mathematical framework than a
particular theory. The issue at hand is which version of QFT to use for
foundational discussions about philosophy. Fraser believes we should use
a QFT called "algebraic quantum field theory" (AQFT), a mathematically
sophisticated version, whereas Wallace advocates for using
"conventional quantum field theory" (CQFT), the theory practicing
physicists actually do practical calculations in. Below, I’ve emphasized
the words that I will explain in later sections.</p>

<p>Fraseer’s argument against using CQFT runs basically as follows. CQFT,
as a theory, is mathematically ill-defined. If we use it in a naive
fashion, the calculations end up giving infinite answers and running in
to <em>Haag’s theorem</em> which basically proves the theory is inconsistent.
We can only cure the infinities and avoid Haag’s theorem in a dubious
fashion (<em>renormalization</em>), which causes the theory to lose its
<em>Lorentz-invariance</em>. A theory this poorly defined can’t be suited to
foundational work; rather, we should use AQFT, which has a
mathematically sound definition and in which none of the above issues
apply. And, after all, though AQFT is less-developed than CQFT, we
already have examples of AQFTs in 2-dimensional spacetimes, and they’re
equivalent to the same theory given in the CQFT formalism, so we should
use the mathematically well-defined theory instead of an ill-defined
mess. We have a genuine case of <em>underdetermination of theory by
evidence</em> and must choose the foundationally sound theory.</p>

<p>Wallace’s counter-argument points out that while 2-dimensional examples
of AQFT exist, there exist no 4-dimensional interacting AQFTs. And, as
you may have noticed, we live in a 4-dimensional world (three spatial
dimensions and time). Therefore, it’s not currently possible to
construct the Standard Model of particle physics in the AQFT framework.
You can, on the other hand, construct the Standard Model in CQFT just
fine. Why would you use AQFT for foundational work when it can’t even
construct the most succesful scientific theory we have? We should
instead prefer CQFT, which is capable of the Standard Model. Wallace
argues also that while renormalization may have been a dubious procedure
in the 1950s, it is now a mathematically well-understood; any problems
it causes with Lorentz-invariance have been made basically irrelevant by
progress in renormalization theory.</p>

<p>Well, that was a mouthful, wasn’t it? Unless you’re already familiar
with QFT, you probably didn’t understand most of it. Let’s fix that.</p>

<h1 id="unitary-inequivalence-and-haags-theorem">Unitary Inequivalence and Haag’s Theorem</h1>

<p>Haag’s theorem is a brilliant result that demonstrates the inconsistency
of quantum field theory – it basically shows the whole theory (in its
CQFT formulation) is mathematically incoherent if applied naively.
Here’s how it works.</p>

<p>Haag wrote down a bunch of obvious-looking assumptions about QFT. For
example, he assumed it’s possible to uniquely define a state with no
particles (duh - obviously you know what "no particles" means), and
that the theory is <em>Lorentz-invariant</em>, that is to say, it obeys
Einstein’s special relativity (speed of light is the maximum speed). All
of the assumptions he made were a standard part of QFT. He then
rug-pulled his audience by showing that they lead to a contradiction –
you can’t possibly satisfy all the assumptions at the same time.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that trying to construct an interacting theory in
this fashion means it’s not <em>unitarily equivalent</em> to the free theory.
Unitarily equivalence basically (skipping over a fair few details) means
that two theories can be described in the same mathematical context –
that they’re, in a vague sense, physically equivalent. Don’t take this
too seriously – the main point is unitarily equivalent = good,
unitarily inequivalent = bad. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it
turns out that any way to write down a proper quantum theory is
unitarily equivalent to all the other ways, even if it looks different
at first sight. In relativistic QFT, no such luck.</p>

<p>So basically, Haag’s theorem says QFT doesn’t work. This is one of the
points Fraser makes in her article – how could we trust such a theory
for foundational work? Unless..</p>

<h1 id="underdetermination">Underdetermination</h1>

<p>Underdetermination of theory by evidence – "underdetermination" for
short – can basically (simplifying a bit again) mean two situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two theories work just as well given all available evidence. Both
theories explain the evidence that has been gathered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two theories work just as well given not only all available
evidence, but even all evidence that could possibly be gathered. Any
empirical predictions from the two theories will always agree.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first variant is very common; it frequently happens that there isn’t
enough evidence yet to favor one theory over another, but often later
evidence appears to rule one of the theories out.</p>

<p>The latter case is more interesting and that is what Fraser has in mind
in her paper: the predictions of AQFT and CQFT actually do agree to any
given accuracy no matter what where AQFT exists.</p>

<p>The problem in the context of the article is that AQFT doesn’t exist for
four spacetime dimensions, so we can’t really say there is any
underdetermination there. In two dimensions, AQFT and CQFT are
underdetermined, though, and one could reasonably argue that AQFT is a
preferable theory.</p>

<h1 id="renormalization-and-the-renormalization-group">Renormalization and the Renormalization Group</h1>

<p>When physicists first started computing physical quantities with QFT,
they ran in to an annoying issue: every result was infinite. Various
people then invented ad-hoc methods to get around this infinity – they
basically swept it under the rug by various tricks that were justified
only in a haphazard intuitive fashion. This trickery was called
renormalization, presumably because they feared calling it
"bullshit" would have hindered the acceptance of the theory.</p>

<p>You can do this in a few ways, and it’s not obvious any of them really
offer satisfactory physical reasons for renormalization. The basic idea
is that you cut off certain properties to cure the infinities. A
straightforward way to do this is to suppose that space is not
continuous and smooth, but rather consists of blocks. These might be
very tiny blocks indeed – far beyond the ability of human eyes or even
particle accelerators to detect – but blocks nonetheless. This removes
the infinities, and if you’re clever you can make the space smooth again
while keeping the infinities away. This involves changing, for example,
the physical mass of the particles in the theory to counterbalance the
infinity. It turns out that doing so also escapes Haag’s theorem, since
the procedure violates the assumptions going in to it.</p>

<p>Well, why not do that then? Because it doesn’t look like our space is in
fact made of tiny blocks! True, the blocks might be invisible to us
because we don’t have sophisticated enough equipment to see them, but
the fact remains that we have no evidence for that. For practical
reasons, physicists nevertheless use this trick, because even if it is
foundationally unsatisfactory, it leads to correct experimental results.</p>

<p>There is another twist to this story, however. The procedure, it turns
out, is not quite as "imaginative" as it seems – and Wallace uses
this in his defence of the ordinary physicist, who goes on happily
renormalizing.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, a brilliant fellow by the name of Ken Wilson was working
on critical phenomena – physics of critical points, like when water
turns to vapor or freezes to ice. Phase transitions!</p>

<p>He was working on a particular problem, which had to do with a block of
pure metal with slight impurities of other materials sprinkled in. He
realized that critical points were caused by phenomena at several scales
working simultaneously. Typically, when investigating a matter
theoretically, you assume one scale is relevant – either a high-energy
or a low-energy situation; long length scales or short length scales,
and so on. Wilson realized that critical points were so hard to
understand because they involved multiple scales, and you couldn’t
ignore any of them.</p>

<p>Wilson didn’t just think that, though. He developed a theory of how
quantities change in different scales. He realized that phase
transitions generally happen in points where calculations at all scales
happen to agree.</p>

<p><img src="/simplyphysics/assets/magnetization_renorm.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The basic way you do this type of calculation is as follows. You first
calculate at one scale. Then you calculate it in a more fine-grained
fashion – for example, if you had a 3x3 = 9 blocks of spacetime, you
increase that to 9x9 = 81. Then you see what this finer calculation
looks like in the coarse-grained case – you divide the 9x9 grid to 3x3
grids and calculate your quantity by averaging over those big blocks. So
at the end, you have two results for the very same quantity.</p>

<p>In the image, I’ve done this calculation for the magnetization of a
famous physics model (the Ising model) for magnetization in different
temperatures. Notice where the two lines cross each other? That’s where
the critical point is! That’s where both scales agree, and the Ising
model loses its magnetization (that generally happens to magnets – if
you heat them too much, they become non-magnetic).</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with renormalization? Well, Wilson showed
that <em>renormalization in QFT basically is this process!</em> The way you
choose the counter-terms to remove the infinities basically involves
writing them as a function of the scale, and the way you can solve the
dependence of e.g. physical mass on the scale is using Wilson’s
renormalization group equations. Didn’t I tell you the guy was
brilliant?</p>

<p>Wilson made sense of renormalization and discovered a deep connection
between particle physics and solid matter physics. Soon after, he
discovered a Nobel prize medal around his neck. Today, this method is
used in various fields of physics (well – people have developed much
more sophisticated algorithms, but the same basic principle).</p>

<p>What this has to do with our discussion is a bit more subtle. Basically,
Wallace says that Wilson’s work on renormalization makes it completely
reasonable to expect that if there’s a further theory – something
deeper than QFT – then of course QFT is going to have oddities in it.
That’s just a matter of scaling, like in the renormalization group
equations. We don’t know what the theory beyond QFT is, but it is not
unreasonable to expect it shows up as infinities in our current theory.</p>

<p>For example, imagine we wanted to model the surface of a metal. Instead
of dealing with individual atoms, of which there are too many to handle,
we might instead describe the surface as a field (this is a method
actually used by condensed matter physicists!). Now if we try to
calculate something at distances smaller than the distance between atoms
on the surface, <em>obviously</em> we’re going to get some sort of nonsensical
result – we’re modeling a bunch of atoms as a field, and if we try to
go in between them, we get nonsense, because we’ve replaced the granular
atomic surface with a continuous one by force. The small distances are
meaningless in our model. They’re beyond the range of application.</p>

<p>Similarly, QFT probably has a scale at which it no longer makes sense.
And that’s fine – Wilson’s renormalization group work tells us what to
do with the scales we can access, and that the scales we can’t access
show up in the theory in the renormalization group equations only
indirectly. There’s no reason to panic if an infinity crops up when we
try to go beyond it.</p>

<h1 id="bringing-it-together">Bringing It Together</h1>

<p>So, where does that leave us? AQFT is mathematically rigorous, but
doesn’t exist in 4 dimensions. It offers a different view of the world
from CQFT, which is mathematically sloppy but has the virtue of
existing.</p>

<p>What is the difference? Well, for example, AQFT doesn’t really have
quanta, which are basically particles. It does have something
approximately like that, but it’s not a fundamental part of it like it
is in CQFT.</p>

<p>Fraser also points out that if there’s really a fundamental theory
beyond QFT, then we can expect there to be some conceptual continuity
between that theory and QFT. That is, we should expect they rely on
similar concepts. So if we’re relying on ill-defined concepts of CQFT,
then might stray in our search for the elusive more fundamental theory
– we’re trying to base it on the wrong concepts!</p>

<p>Wallace wants to say that QFT is approximately true and thus offers us
an approximate guide to foundational philosophical work. Fraser wants to
answer the question: if QFT were rigorously defined and exactly true,
what does it say about the world?</p>

<p>I think Fraser’s problem is that her proposed theory doesn’t exist. This
is a massive problem – if I started hitting on ladies by bragging about
my imaginary Ferrari, I would quickly encounter a problem. Even if we
conceded that CQFT is hopelessly bad as a theory (which it clearly
isn’t, since it is at least empirically succesful!), that would give us
no reason whatsoever to trust what AQFT says about short-distance
physics. Until a realistic AQFT theory exists – one that is capable of
reproducing the Standard Model – it seems foolish to trust anything it
says about physics.</p>

<p>In any case, hopefully you learned something about the phraseology of
this field of philosophy. The articles I based this on are Wallace’s
"Taking particle physics seriously: A critique of the algebraic
approach to quantum field theory" (2011) and Fraser’s "Quantum Field
Theory: Underdetermination, Inconsistency, and Idealization" (2009).</p>
