I'm Ray G. Nordstrom, a physicist who totally could've won a Nobel prize, but decided to pursue figure skating in Rio instead. I now live in an island off the coast of Mexico with three penguins and a dog. The penguins took control of the island in 2021, and I have been living under their watchful eye ever since. I am allowed to leave the island, I just choose not to due to my love of the penguins. Rumors that they prevent me from leaving under threat of being slapped by a penguin wing are total exaggerations. They're benevolent overlords.

Speaking seriously for a moment -- the name is a pen name and inspired by the little-known Finnish theoretical physicist Gunnar Nordström, who created one of the early competitors to the theory of general relativity. G. Nordström was the first to develop a metric theory of gravitation and did quite a bit for Finnish physics in general. Here's a picture of him (on the left) as a youth:
